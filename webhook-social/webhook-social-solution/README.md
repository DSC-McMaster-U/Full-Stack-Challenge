# Firebase Socail Challenge

In this challenge we will create a basic chat app using firebase auth, firestore, and cloud functions!

## Your Challenge
* If a user tries to message an email not in the system, send that person an invite email
* Dissapearing ink mode - make chats dissapear when read
* Display the latest message on the chatList screen
* Add error messages when creating a chat and something goes wrong
* Avoid creating duplicate chats (if someoe creates a chat that already exist, just redirect them to that screen)
* Make the dates pretty (hint use DayJS on npm)
* Make it look good when there are enough messages to scroll
